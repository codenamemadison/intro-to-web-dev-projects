      What seems like a normal mouse my friend during Freshmen year had given me
      turned into what would eventually allow me to fuel a later gaming addiction.
      Freshmen year I had gotten into League of Legends the same time as many of my
      other friends did, and this mouse served as my ride or die through those fun times.
      Playing with our other friends who have been playing for years, we found ourselves
      playing for hours - frequently
      playing in the common areas and conference rooms of our dorm and even having 5v5's in-person
      as our way to spend our week nights.
      <br> <br>
      And although whenever I talk to one of these college friends about these experiences
      we always complain about the sleep and time we lost from it, the special way we all bonded through
      the mutual enjoyment of the same video game and learning how to play at the
      same time created a unique bond in its own way. Many of the people who
      tried playing Freshmen year nowadays have stopped playing or lost interest - as I have as well -
      but some of our core or first memories with each other had been created because of
      mutual interests like this.
      <br> <br>
      Although I do want to end on a wholesome note, I must also note League is
      a terrible, awful game that has plagued society as
      we know it. So, in conclusion if you want to play a video game with your friends,
      first uninstall League and THEN consider your options.
