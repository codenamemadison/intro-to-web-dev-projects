      <h2> Why did you make this website? </h2>
      <p> I personally struggle with managing my workload for
      school and my outside-of-school responsibilities as well as
      sometimes struggle to find a productivity technique that works.
      This website was initially meant as a way to compile different
      solutions that could help with this for people like me
      and to help put all the tools and resources that can and/or do benefit
      me in one place.
