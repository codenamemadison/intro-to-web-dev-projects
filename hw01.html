          “As We May Think”
          </a>
          - Vannevar Bush, 1945  </h2>
        <p> In this article, Vannevar Bush discusses the many interesting ways technology has
          influenced not only how we preserve information and knowledge but also how we organize,
          consult, and interact with this information and data. On the same note, Bush discusses
          the idea of the “memex”, or a device that can be used to “[store] all his books, records,
          and communications”. This memex would allow the user to more effectively manage and access
          different types of content as well as to be able to share this content with others. This
          revolutionary idea would later materialize into what we know as the World Wide Web and the
          internet.</p>

            "Long Live the Web"
          </a> - Tim Berners Lee, 2010
        </h2>
        <p> In this article, Time Berners Lee brings up many interesting concerns as to how the Web
          should be and how it is being controlled. Lee discusses how the Web’s greatness lies in its
          importance in a democracy, its ability to host global conversations surrounding issues people
          care about, and its universality in who can access the content. In these ways does Lee brings
          up the issue surrounding net neutrality and how the ways the internet and the Web help us
          can be used to potentially hurt us. Specifically, Lee makes many compelling points surrounding
          how, without net neutrality, Internet Service Providers (ISP)’s can potentially control how
          fast or slow your connection is or what type of content you can access and make these decisions
          based on their own biases. This makes me think about how much power ISP’s have since, without
          net neutrality, ISP’s could have the power to purposefully limit what kind of content we consume,
          ranging from which newspapers and news outlets we have access/have a faster connection
          to, to what type of entertainment you can view online. This made me realize how ISP’s
          essentially have the potential to completely shape how we learn about the world and our
          perception of it through what we are able to access on the Internet and how scary this
          potential is. In doing so, they would be able to shape the thoughts and knowledge of their
          customers and take advantage of what we have taken for granted.
